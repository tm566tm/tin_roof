
I included what has been tested. I'll test and fix the bugs of the other requirements (not included in this package) when I have more time to night. Thanks.

1) Postman test content

URLs:
GET (all)
http://localhost:8080/calendarevents/
POST
http://localhost:8080/calendarevents/
PUT
http://localhost:8080/calendarevents/1
DELETE
http://localhost:8080/calendarevents/1


JSON to use:
{
    "id": 2,
    "calendarId": 2,
    "calendar": {
        "name": "n2",
        "organizer": "o2"
    },
    "title": "t2",
    "location": "t23333",
    "attendeeList": "list",
    "reminderHasBeenSent": false,
    "reminderTime": "2018-06-29T07:21:20.893",
    "eventDateAndTime": "2018-06-29T07:21:20.892"
}


2) During server start up, the exception below is thrown be cause the version of Derby database packaged with Spring boot doesn't have a schema with the name 'SA'. This is a quick fix when connected to an external database with the statement 'CREATE SCHEMA SA;'. The embedded Derby copy doen'st seem to be able to pick this up via the schema.sql file I added.
