1) After started the app, in Postman, do the posts with the JSONs provided below. 

POST URL: 
http://localhost:8080/calendarevents/


JSON to use (please do 1 post at a time):
First one,
	{
		"title":"Meeting 1",
		"location":"room 1",
		"attendeeList":"Bob V., Lisa S., Tim J.",
		"reminderHasBeenSent":false,
		"reminderTime":"2018-06-29T07:21:20.893",
		"eventDateAndTime":"2018-06-29T07:21:20.892",
		"calendar": 
        {
            "name": "Huey M.",
            "userName": "hm2"
        }
	
	}


Second one,
	{
		"title":"Meeting 2",
		"location":"room 2",
		"attendeeList":"Jim V., Linda S., Vict J.",
		"reminderHasBeenSent":false,
		"reminderTime":"2018-07-30T07:21:20.893",
		"eventDateAndTime":"2018-07-30T07:21:20.892",
		"calendar": 
        {
            "name": "Huey M.",
            "userName": "hm2"
        }
	
	}


Third one,
	{
		"title":"Meeting 3",
		"location":"room 3",
		"attendeeList":"Jenn V., Kim S., Tom J.",
		"reminderHasBeenSent":false,
		"reminderTime":"2018-06-30T07:21:20.893",
		"eventDateAndTime":"2018-06-30T07:21:20.892",
		"calendar": 
        {
            "name": "Tom J.",
            "userName": "tm3"
        }
	
	}


2) After the posts, use the URL below in Postman to do a GET call to the API to display the events of the month of June. 

GET URL: 
http://localhost:8080/calendareventsbymonth/june


3) To save time, I skipped retrieving by week and day since they're of similar concepts as retrieving by month.
