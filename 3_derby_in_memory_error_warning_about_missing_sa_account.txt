During server start up, the message below is shown on the console because the version of Derby database packaged with Spring boot doesn't have a schema with the name 'SA'. 
This is a quick fix when connected to an external database with the statement 'CREATE SCHEMA SA;'. 
The embedded Derby copy doen'st seem to be able to pick this up via the schema.sql file I added but all transactions to and from the database will work regardless of this.
* Each time the app is restarted, the database is cleaned out.
